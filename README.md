# README

This is part of the teaching material for the course "Laboratory of AI applications", for the Master Degree in Management Engineering of the University of Bologna.

The material consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks. You can execute them by:

* Opening a terminal emulator window on this folder
* Executing the command `jupyter notebook`

Remember to make sure you have all the dependencies installed; you can find them in the "requirements.txt" file.

You can also find PDF slides corresponding to the notebook content in the "pdfs" folder, but of course those won't be inteactive.
